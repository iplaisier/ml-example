This repository serves the goal of showing a simple and classic machine learning example, to indicate my abbility of the usage of PyTorch. 

Example: Digit recognition using the MNIST data set  
         notebook: MNIST_digitrecognition.ipynb  
         This notebooks shows with the usage of a convolutional network that handwritten number can be identified.
