This repository serves the goal of showing a simple and classic machine learning example, to indicate my ability of the usage of PyTorch. 

# Example: Review classification of the AG news data set 
notebook: AGnews_classification.ipynb  
This notebook identifies the topic of a given review with the help of word embeddings. 


# Example: Digit recognition using the MNIST data set  
notebook: MNIST_digitrecognition.ipynb  
This notebooks shows with the usage of a convolutional network that handwritten numbers can be identified.
