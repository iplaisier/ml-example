This repository serves the goal of showing a simple and classic machine learning example, to indicate my ability of the usage of PyTorch. 

# Example: Review classification of the AG news data set 
notebook: AGnews_classification.ipynb  
This notebook identifies the topic of a review. 
The following approaches are used for the classification:
1. SWEM: word embeddings are computed, and the average word embedding per review is classified into the topics.
2. RNN: word embeddings are computed, which are feeded to an RNN, and then connected to a read out layer which classifies the review into toppics. 


# Example: Digit recognition using the MNIST data set  
notebook: MNIST_digitrecognition.ipynb  
This notebooks shows with the usage of a convolutional network that handwritten numbers can be identified.
